## INTRODUCTION[![](./images/pin.svg)](#introduction)
The question we explored pertains to how much of an impact graduating with a STEM (science,
technology, engineering, and math) degree has on early-career salaries. On average, STEM
majors earn $65,000, while non-STEM majors earn about $15,500 less. STEM majors were also
more likely to be employed and hold only one full-time job, rather than a part-time job or
multiple jobs [1]. In addition, STEM workers who majored in a STEM field in college typically
made higher salaries than those who did not: on average, $101,100 vs. $87,600 [2]. According to
a study of 159 college degrees by the personal finance company Bankrate, all 25 of its
top-earning majors are ‚ÄòSTEM‚Äô majors [3]. Overall, it seems that STEM students, on average,
make more money than non-STEM students. 

**For our project, we will focus on analyzing graduates of college and university in Virginia.**

## HYPOTHESIS[![](./images/pin.svg)](#hypothesis)
***The United States early salary potential for graduates of public and private colleges and
universities in Virginia is at least $5000 higher for colleges and universities that have a
percentage of STEM students above or at 20%.***

## FIGURES![](./images/pin.svg)

### **Figures Table**
* Scatterplot with Trend Line
* Boxplot
* Average Difference between Salaries
* R-Squared Value and Significance Tests

### **Scatterplot with Trend Line**
![](./figures/salary_and_stem.png)

The graph shows a positive, linear, and
moderately strong correlation between the two variables shown by the trend line. The confidence level is
higher where the population is between 0% and 20%, since there are more data points compared to the low
number of observations from the 20% to 40% population.

### **Boxplot**
![](./figures/boxplot_stem.png)

This plot measures the same two variables of early career pay and STEM populations at each school in
VA. The boxplot below compares the two groups of STEM populations greater than or less than 20%. Key
points are that the median salary for the less than 20% group is about $50000, and the greater than 20%
group has a median salary of about $58000. This is evidence that helps support our hypothesis. Looking at
the two groups, we can also see that the spread for the low STEM population group is higher. There are no
outliers shown by the graphs.

### **Average Difference between Salaries**

|stem_percent > 20|average|standard deviation|
|-----------------|-------|------------------|
|FALSE|51761|5852|
|TRUE|58400|7074|

Descriptive statistics for Average and SD of Early Career Pay. Next, we computed the average pay and
standard deviation for pay for each group. Although the averages support our hypothesis, the standard
deviations are somewhat high.

### **R-Squared Value and Significance Tests**

|Value||
|----|---|
|R-Squared Value|0.5882328|
|P-Value|0.001983|

Calculating R-Squared Value of the correlation and significance. Finding the correlation coefficient comes
out to 59%. 59% of the variation in the early career pay variable is explained by the STEM population at
each school.
Testing Significance 1. Null hypothesis: variable 1 and variable have a correlation equal to 0. 2. Alternative
hypothesis: variable 1 and variable 2 have a correlation not equal to 0.
Running a significance test on the two variables, we found that the p-value was .001983. At a 95% confidence
level, we can reject the null hypothesis that the correlation is equal to 0 as the p-value is statistically
significant. The confidence interval is above 0, which supports the decision to reject the null hypothesis as
well, although the range is quite large, likely due to the limited number of observations in the dataset.
In conclusion, there is a significant relationship between early career pay and STEM populations in Virginia
colleges and universities.
