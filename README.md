## INTRODUCTION[![](./images/pin.svg)](#introduction)
The question we explored pertains to how much of an impact graduating with a STEM (science,
technology, engineering, and math) degree has on early-career salaries. On average, STEM
majors earn $65,000, while non-STEM majors earn about $15,500 less. STEM majors were also
more likely to be employed and hold only one full-time job, rather than a part-time job or
multiple jobs [1]. In addition, STEM workers who majored in a STEM field in college typically
made higher salaries than those who did not: on average, $101,100 vs. $87,600 [2]. According to
a study of 159 college degrees by the personal finance company Bankrate, all 25 of its
top-earning majors are ‘STEM’ majors [3]. Overall, it seems that STEM students, on average,
make more money than non-STEM students. 

**For our project, we will focus on analyzing graduates of college and university in Virginia.**

## HYPOTHESIS[![](./images/pin.svg)](#hypothesis)
***The United States early salary potential for graduates of public and private colleges and
universities in Virginia is at least $5000 higher for colleges and universities that have a
percentage of STEM students above or at 20%.***
